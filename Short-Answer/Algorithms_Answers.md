#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) The loop increases linearly with every elements increases in run "n" times. 


b) O(n log n) Two loops. Inter loop j is doubling the outer for loop increase linearly with "n".
   When the number of elements increases the time doesn't increase as much.


c)  O(n) The function is linear related to it's input and the bunnies are being subtracted by 1 until the base is met.


## Exercise II
Binary search O(log n) because we don't need to drop a egg from every floor.

Every time we drop an egg we do so from the middle of the range. 

1. Start at ground_story

2. Walk to middle floor range and drop the egg 

3. If it breaks the higher floors should be eliminated. 

4. If eggs doesn't break eliminate all lower floors.

5. From the next group of floor middle
   repeat the process of until you find "f"
